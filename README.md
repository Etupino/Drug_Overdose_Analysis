# Drug_Overdose_Analysis

# Background
For this project, we focused on a specific dataset from the database Kaggle. We want to analyze the trends in the drug-related overdoses in CT. The dataset was titled “Drug Overdose Deaths: Accidental drug related deaths during 2012 - 2018.” This data set provided us with various information of an individual's age, race, gender, place of death, cause of death, etc. 
As a group, we wanted to bring awareness to the drug overdose pandemic across the U.S. and which particular drugs were contributing to these high death tolls. To accomplish this goal we cleaned our data to observe the following trends and answer the questions we felt significant to this topic.
